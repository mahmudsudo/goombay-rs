# goombay-rs

Rust implementation of my goombay python project. Implements several sequence
alignment algorithms such as Waterman-Smith-Beyer, Gotoh, and Needleman-Wunsch
intended to calculate distance, show alignment, and display the underlying matrices.

## Installation

Add Goombay-rs as a dependency in your Cargo.toml:

```nginx
[dependencies]
goombay-rs = { git = "https://github.com/lignum-vitae/goombay-rs" }`
```

Then run:

`cargo build`

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| edit   | Algorithms that use edit distance as an alignment tool such as Needleman-Wunsch |

### Running Examples

Working examples of the available algorithms as well as a full list of available algorithms can be found in the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/lignum-vitae/goombay-rs/tree/main/goombay-rs/examples) directory.

Run any example with the following command:

`cargo run --example <example_name>`

Do not include `.rs` when running examples.
